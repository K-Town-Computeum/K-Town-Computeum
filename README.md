👋 Hi, I’m Peter (aka @K-Town-Computeum)

👀 I’m running a private computer museum called 'K-Town Computeum' in Germany for vintage computers from the 70's, 80's and 90's.
My collection is mainly comprised of historic computers from Sun, SGI, HP, IBM, NeXT and Apple.

🌱 I’m trying to learn more about these machines and their operating systems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reparing and restoring these machines and their operating systems / software.
